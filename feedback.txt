- project organization 1
This should be a relatively quick fix. In order to  improve in this area simply make an image folder and store all of your images in there. They are currently all in your code folder along with your presentation. This made it difficult for me to find your presentation and initially I thought you had not included it in your repo. Also, delete or untrack any unnecessary files in your final submission such as the project style guide.

- clarity of message 2
You clearly put a ton of work into this project and when I read your conclusions and recommendations it was clear you understood the data very well. However when I read through your EDA it was oftentimes difficult to follow your logic. You included so many statistics as an uninformed reader it was hard to tell which were important to your overall message. Editing out sections that don't support your narrative/conclusions will help focus your project and make it easier for your reader to follow your train of thought.

- python syntax and control flow 3
Your code demonstrates a mastery of all of the concepts covered so far. Your code is syntactically correct and generates the desired results. Great work here. Your technical skills are outstanding and the main areas for improvement come in the other assessment categories relating to narrative structure.

- data cleaning and eda 2
You fixed all of the data formatting issues and you merged your datasets appropriately. You also included a lot of summary statistics in your EDA which is great. The one thing you could improve here is to relate those statistics back to your overall problem statement/project. Your markdown describes what the statistics are but not how they are relevant to your project.

- visualizations 3
Great work here. You included all of the requested visualizations as well as many more.

- conceptual understanding 2
Good work citing your sources. When you interpret inferential and descriptive statistics try to relate them back to your overall project so your reader knows how they fit in and support your narrative.

- presentation 1
The main reason for the score here is that you were significantly over the 4 minute time limit. Your presentation took a similar approach as the rest of your project which was to include everything you could so as not to miss anything. This caused your overall narrative to become watered down and it was at times hard to know how a particular graph was important/relevant to your overall problem statement/conclusions. Editing out graphs that aren't directly supporting your conclusions will help reduce the time of the presentation while also focusing your narrative.
